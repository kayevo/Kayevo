### Hi, great to see you here on GitHub! My name is Johnatan Kayevo and I hope you like my projects. ðŸ‘‹
</br>

I upload code from projects I enjoy developing onto GitHub. I sincerely hope that the software I have created can assist you in coding more effectively if you are a developer or enable you to analyze some of my work if you are a recruiter.

Now, to talk to me, you can click here and contact me through my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kayevo/).
