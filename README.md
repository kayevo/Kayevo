### Hi, great to see you here on GitHub! My name is Johnatan Kayevo and I hope you like my codes. ðŸ‘‹
</br>

I insert code from projects that I like to develop into GitHub. I really want the software I created can help you codding better if you're a developer, or to analyze some of my work if you're a recruiter. 

If you have any questions, you can contact me through my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kayevo/).
